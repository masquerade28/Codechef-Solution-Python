'''
  In the new CodeChef Learn module, under the "Learn Problem Solving" section, there are two courses for each language. 
  For eg. "Python Beginner - Part 1" and "Python Beginner - Part 2". 
  These courses help you get started with CodeChef contests.
  Currently there are courses for 4 languages, and hence there are 8 courses in this section. 
  But suppose there are courses for N languages, what will be the total number of courses in this section?
'''

# Taking Input For N = No. Of Languages For Which There Are Courses.
N = int(input())

# If there are N languages, then there will be 2âˆ—N courses in total.
print(N*2)
